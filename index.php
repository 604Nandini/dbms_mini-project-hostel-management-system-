 Hostels provide budget-oriented, sociable accommodation where students can register and book a bed.
This new hostel building comprises of basement, ground and three upper floors which was completed in the year 2002 to accommodate around 200 students. 
Rooms with 2,3 and 4 sharing with attached toilet and bathrooms with internet facility. Our hostel along with our college is located in the centre 
of the city making it the best choice for the students.
And the benefit – it’s easy to find, so all the entertainment is within easy
walking distance and you don’t have to spend money on public transportation and hence not a problem to find food even at 4:00am.
